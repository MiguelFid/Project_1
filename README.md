# Project 1: SpaceY Rocket Landing Prediction

This project is part of the IBM Data Scientist Certificate and aims to demonstrate the application of data science skills in a practical scenario.

## Project Description

In this project, I will apply the knowledge acquired during the course to solve a real-world problem in the space industry. The goal is to predict whether a rocket, similar to SpaceX's Falcon rockets, will successfully land after launch. The company, **SpaceY**, is looking to enhance its rocket landing technology by leveraging machine learning models to predict the probability of success or failure.

## Problem Statement

A space rocket production company, **SpaceY**, needs to predict the landing success of their rockets after launch. These rockets are designed to return and land after completing their mission. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a rocket will land successfully or fail.

## Objectives


- **Data Analysis**:
- **Data Analysis**:
- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to understand key factors that influence rocket landing.
- **Feature Engineering**: Engineer features that could help improve model performance.
- **Model Development**: Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a rocket will land successfully or fail.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics to ensure its accuracy and performance.
- **Documentation**: Provide thorough documentation, explaining the steps taken, insights discovered, and the reasoning behind the model.

## Dataset

The dataset will contain variables such as:
-
-
-
-
-
-

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Data manipulation, model building
- **Pandas**: Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **NumPy**: Mathematical operations
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning model development
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Documentation and presentation of the project
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and project sharing

## Steps to Follow

1. Data acquisition and cleaning


## Final Output

By the end of the project, the goal is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting whether SpaceY rockets will land successfully or not, based on various input features. The results will be presented through visualizations, and the performance of the model will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and other appropriate metrics.
